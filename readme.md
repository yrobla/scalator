Revisely autoscaling tools
==========================

Installation
------------

Revisely's autoscaling tools are written in Python 2, and run almost(!) out of the box on any Linux system by simply typing:

```
python <script_name>
```

However, there are a number of Python libraries that might not be installed, namely:

* Skiff, to be installed with ```sudo pip install skiff``` 
* pysftp, to be installed with ```sudo pip install pysftp```

If you do not have pip installed, do:

```
sudo apt-get install python-pip
```
